    <p>
      These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of software, services,
      websites, content, and documentation provided by Final Boss Technology, Inc.
      (“Final Boss,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using our services, you agree to
      these Terms. If you are using the services on behalf of an organization, you represent
      that you have authority to bind that organization.
    </p>

    <h2>1. License</h2>
    <p>
      Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable,
      revocable license to access and use our services for your internal business purposes.
      Except as expressly permitted, you may not copy, modify, distribute, host, sublicense,
      sell, or create derivative works of the services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No reverse engineering, decompilation, or circumvention of security controls.</li>
      <li>No use that violates law, infringes intellectual property, or harms others.</li>
      <li>No automated scraping or rate‑limiting avoidance except as expressly allowed by us in writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Accounts & Security</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for safeguarding credentials and for all activities under your
      account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      We and our licensors retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the services,
      including software, models, workflows, designs, and documentation.

    </p>

    <h2>5. Third‑Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      If you access our solution via marketplaces or integrations (e.g., Databricks), you must
      also comply with those third‑party terms. Where those terms conflict with these Terms,
      these Terms control between you and Final Boss.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Confidentiality & Data</h2>
    <p>
      We handle Customer Data according to our Privacy Notice. You retain ownership of your data.
      You agree not to transmit sensitive personal data unless we have a written agreement permitting it.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
      WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER FINAL BOSS NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF
      PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY
      YOU TO US FOR THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Suspension & Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or to protect the services.
      Upon termination, your license ends and you must stop using the services.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Updates to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with an updated
      effective date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
